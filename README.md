## ballgame

This is a Docker project. To get started, run `docker compose up --d` from the project root.

*jan. 1*
- created vite app for frontend
- ballgame container is now the frontend react/vite app instead of a django app
- set up docker on windows, went smoothly
- chadwick register is a little tricky, we don't want it to function as a git repo inside of our git repo
- set up API to return all players
- tried to set up shadcn ui and tailwind but it doesn't seem to be working. Think i included the css wrong somehow
- next: create the player list table
- after: create the dashboard
